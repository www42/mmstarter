# Use permalinks!

[Permalinks](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/) are the output path for your pages and posts. 
{: .notice--info}

Use a single folder *_pages* to store all pages centrally and put them individually at the right output path via the [permalink mechanism](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/pages/).

Examples:

| filename             | permalink    |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| `_pages/about.md`    | `/about/`    |
| `_pages/projects.md` | `/projects/` |
| `_pages/404.md`      | `/404.html`  |
| `_pages/contact.md`  | `/contact/`  |
  

# Don't touch the `_site` folder!

The `_site`folder contains the complete static web site generated by jekyll.

jekyll usage:

`bundle exec jekyll build` | one-time building of the web site
`bundle exec jekyll serve -livereload` | build and serve the web site continuously

`bundle exec` is required to use the gems defined in the Gemfile.


# Tables without headers

Most Markdown parser require a table header definition

```bash
| head column 1  | head column 2 | 
| -------------- | --------------| 
| foo            | bar           | 
```

In Kramdown used by Jekyll it's fine to omit the header and separation line

```bash
| foo            | bar           | 
```


# Ruby's Pessimistic Operator `~>`

In a `Gemfile`

```bash
gem "webrick", "~> 1.7"
```

means `bundle install` will install the highest version of `webrick` between the range `>= 1.7` and `< 2.0`. See [Dan Croak](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/rubys-pessimistic-operator).



# When is  `bundle update` useful? And what is `Gemfile.lock`?

See [bundler docs](https://bundler.io/v1.13/man/bundle-update.1.html)

> The update command will ignore the Gemfile.lock and use the latest versions of each gem in the Gemfile.


# Info on a particular gem

```bash
bundle info webrick
bundle info minimal-mistakes-jekyll
```
