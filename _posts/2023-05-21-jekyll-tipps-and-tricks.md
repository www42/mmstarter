## Use permalinks!

[Permalinks](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/) are the output path for your pages and posts. [Use a single folder *_pages*](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/pages/) to store all pages centrally and put them individually at the right output path via the permalink mechanism.

Examples:

filename | permalink
--- | ---
`_pages/about.md` | `/about/`
`_pages/projects.md` | `/projects/`
`_pages/404.md` | `/404.html`
`_pages/contact.md` | `/contact/`

## Don't touch the `_site` folder!

The `_site`folder contains the complete static web site generated by jekyll.

jekyll usage:

`jekyll build` | one-time building of the web site
`jekyll serve livereload` | build and serve the web site continuously
